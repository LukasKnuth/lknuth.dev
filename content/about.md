Hi, I'm Lukas.

I knew very early that I wanted to program computers for a living.
Having done it for a while now, I still enjoy it immensely and have no plans to shift careers to woodworking.
More than ever I enjoy making things simple and working on solutions in a team.

I like endurance cycling.
You can find me on the bike or indoor trainer most days of the week.
It lets me attain a meditative state where my head is truly completely empty.

I enjoy games, both on the board and on the screen.
I prefer games with strong moment-to-moment gameplay - like platformers, shooters and competitive games.
These days I'm looking for short games that can fit into a busy schedule.

If your interest is piqued, read about my [recent personal pursuits](/now) or find my [professional career path](/cv) on their dedicated pages.
