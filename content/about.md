Hi, I'm Lukas and I make computers do useful things for a living.

I found my passion for computers pretty early in my live and have been on a straight path towards my career ever since, getting vocational training and a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

Since I started my professional career, I have been a Mobile Developer on Android, a Web Developer using multiple frontend frameworks, a Full-Stack Developer focused on NodeJS, Ruby and Elixir and most recently a Senior Backend Developer working mostly with Elixir.

I most enjoy the technical aspects of the job, the actual coding as well as communicating complex technical concepts efficiently to non-technical colleagues.

The writings in this Blog represent my own opinions. The topics range broadly, and so does the quality. I only write here when inspiration strikes.
