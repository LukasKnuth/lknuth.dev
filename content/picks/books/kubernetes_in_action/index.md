This was the single best resource to dive into Kubernetes, back when I didn't know anything about it.
The book requires almost on up-front knowledge.
It introduces concepts in an order that makes sense and ensures you have a full picture of a topic before moving on.
Each chapter ramps up the complexity piece by piece.
I read part 2 of the book cover-to-cover and was confident enough to muck about on the production cluster afterward.

The book doubles as a reference guide that I have consulted many times since.
It is usually better at introducing a topic than the official documentation.
The index at the end makes it easy to find chapters based on keywords.
Even now that my hardcopy is becoming more and more outdated, I still use it to get started and then look for further documentation elsewhere.

Many of the internals are discussed in part 3, which I skipped initially.
I have since come back to it piece by piece, as new concepts where required or just because I was interested.
That said, I don't think experienced Kubernetes users will get much out of this book.
