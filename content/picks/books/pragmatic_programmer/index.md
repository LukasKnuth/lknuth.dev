I bounced off of this book twice before it clicked.
I felt much of the advice was correct but useless, in a "don't touch the stove, it's hot" kind of way; you won't value it until your hand has been burned already.
On my third attempt though, I read the book cover-to-cover.

Because your professional circumstances change over time, you'll get different things out of the book every time.
TODO why am I picking this book again? Re-read this and update the review afterwards...

The book does not pick a language/framework/paradigm to evangelize.
Rather, it is two whole careers worth of advice, loosely collected.
This means that the book has no specific order in which it must be read.
Some of it is very specific, but some is not.
Other times 


### Alternative reading path

If you find yourself bouncing off of the early chapters and question if you should continue the book, try this algorithm:

1. Open the table of contents or the full list of tips at the end of the book.
2. Pick anything that looks interesting and add the chapters to a list `L`
3. Pop the first entry from `L` and read the chapter.
4. If you reach the end of the Chapter, prepend any interesting "Related Sections" to `L`
5. Goto 3

This depth-first approach to reading the book will let you follow your curiosity.
If you keep an additional set `S` on paper and note every chapter you've already read, you can both plot your way through the book and know which chapters you haven't read yet at the end.
