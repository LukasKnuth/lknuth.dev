## Credo

- These are not reviews: there is no rating or negative ones, they're all recommendations.
- Spoiler free: as a rule of thumb, the first 15 min are fair game (mostly for movies)
- Pitch: I try to write these out as I would verbal pitches made at a BBQ
- It's about ideas: What does it want to say? How does it make me feel? What are its ideas and motives?
- Information: Up front about anything that might prevent someone from enjoying this
- No visuals: Especially for games, visuals can lead to "judging the book by its cover". Instead, lets talk about the ideas. That way, perhaps someone might look past their own bias and try something new before hopping out early with "this doesn't look like I'd like it".
