After he is released from prison, a man returns to his childhood home on a small fishing island.
Along with him, a new priest arrives in the suffering community.
Then, the miracles begin.

In the realm of Mike Flanagan (Haunting of Hill House) shows, this one is the least "jump scare" scary one.
While there are some classic horror tropes in the show, it finds most of its frights in its investigation of religion.
Is it a tool for healing and acceptance, or a corrupting influence?
The shows main themes all revolve around this central question.
It's a slow burner but increases the heat bit by bit until the boiling point is reached.

Some episodes are like plays rather than traditional television.
One of my most vivid memories of this show is from a conversation that two central characters have about what happens after you die.
The dialog show is written beautifully, almost poetic and the circumstances under which they are discussing the topic adds another layer on top.
This character drama is what this show is great at, and it creates these moments frequently.
