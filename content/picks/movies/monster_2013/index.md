A young boy is bullied by a teacher at school.
A young boy bullies another boy at school.
A young boy makes a friend at school.

Stating only that this movie uses the trope of "multiple perspectives" does it a disservice.
The immediate association one might get from this description confines it unfairly to a box.
There is no big hidden twist; No great reveal of the real truth; No obstruction of reality by unreliable narration.
Instead, there are just perspectives.
All of them - by their own nature - incomplete.

The movie is beautifully shot and has great performances.
However, what elevates it for me is the restraint that the creators show.
This could have easily devolved into a "clever" movie that puts the emphasis on its central narrative device.
Instead, at its heart, it is a tender coming of age story.
One that is infinitely more complex than a single perspective would allow us to grasp.

The adults in the film are preoccupied by ensuring their own public persona complies with their societies cultural norms.
They manipulate the perspective of others (and themselves) in service of this goal.
This shapes the reality which these characters inhabit and makes the ending so devastating.
