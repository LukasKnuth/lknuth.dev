This is science fiction in its most literal form.
A mix of real science as the basis and a good dose of fiction to spice things up.
But there are no spaceships or lasers here, just a group of friends at a dinner party during a comet flyby.
As the evening progresses, weird things continue to happen.

The movie shows "normal" people faced with something that they don't have the capacity to understand.
There is no expert character that is able to _solve_ anything.
Everyone is equally stumped and tries to make sense of what is happening.
Theories are thrown out, bits of science sprinkled in like normal every day discourse where you're quite sure you read this thing some time ago that said...
It makes the movies wilder ideas feel grounded because ultimately, they are just theories by laypeople, trying to grasp at things they can't explain.

In the ensuing chaos and confusion, some people show their true colors.
Some rise to the occasion, others falter.
And some look to further their own causes.
We're watching people after all, they're complicated.

The movie feels intimate and raw, as the viewer you feel almost like you're intruding.
Shot on a budget in the directors own home with a tiny cast and no crew, this is very intentional.
And while the camera work can be disorienting at first, I think the story is better off for it.
