This is one of these games that has a strong core mechanic: a momentum preserving drill that lets you tunnel through terrain.
First, it is introduced in progressively less safe environments.
Once you "get it", the mechanic is recontextualized in as many ways as developers could come up with.
What if terrain had a time limit?
What if you weren't digging down but up through falling chunks?
What if jelly?

Some levels are more daring than that, fully substituting your drill for a minigun.
While these are certainly different, I felt the loss of the main mechanic quite strongly here.
The game is at its best when it gives you long spaces that you can burrow through, catching air as you surface and preserve your momentum, flying from block to block, making quick decisions and looking out for collectibles. 

There is great attention to detail in the levels.
Both in the different biomes, the levels backgrounds and objects laying about.
Everything feels like it has a function in this world, it makes the spaces you zip through feel lived in.
You gradually get an idea of the society of bipedal unicorns you're carving your way through.

The game does not overstay its welcome.
Most level ideas are one-off, so every level feels fresh.
After about three hours you get a great boss fight and see the credits.
