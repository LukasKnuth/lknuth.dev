In Ape Out you play as the titular ape, trying to break out.
The thing you're breaking out of is many varieties of cages.
In the literal sense.
Ape Out is not interested in the philosophical questions of being an unwilling participant in experiments or being kidnapped from your home.

Instead, the game gives you about 250 kg of muscle to throw around and do something about it.
When a shoved enemy meets an immovable object, they splash an abstract art piece onto the wall.
Everything in this game drips with style.
The improvised jazz drums that react to your actions.
The long shadows cast from overhead through the level.
The violent pastel color palette on all surfaces.

This game is hard.
Fighting for your freedom often is.
You die very quickly, but restarts are fast so you go again.
And then you get into the rhythm.
You smash through the levels.
And after about four hours, this cathartic experience concludes in a grand finale.
Bravo.

If you want a more visual review to grasp the games style, there is a wonderful [Jacob Geller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H89AbaFA3w) review/essay about this game.
It does **contain spoilers** for the ending, which I advise to avoid.
