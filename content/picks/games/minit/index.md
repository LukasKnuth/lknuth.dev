It starts like any classic adventure game: you find a sword; it's dangerous to go alone after all.
Only this time, the sword is cursed and kills you after 60 seconds.
A death resets you to your last spawn.
Then, you set out anew.

The game is not a time loop, time continues normally after you die.
Why you don't run into corpses of yourself scattered everywhere then is left open.
Minit isn't an exploration of multiverse theory - it's just interested in how the hard time-limit changes the classic adventure game formula.

For one, it augments the feeling of being lost in an open world.
There is no map, no quest log and no companion or hint system.
This is made less daunting by the fact that you only have a minute to explore per life - you can't get _that_ far.
Inevitably, you stumble upon something interesting, but there isn't time to investigate to your hearts content.
But now, you have an objective that you can focus your limited time on and optimize your path.
This usually leads to new discoveries along the way, interesting places you'll have to file in your brain for later because there isn't time for them now.

The game wields the tropes of the genre very comfortably.
You just found a flashlight?
Wonder if that will be helpful in the dark tunnel you found earlier...
The level design makes places you can not progress _yet_ memorable enough that you remember them immediately when you find the appropriate item. 

The story is mostly an excuse to go from place A to B.
The combat is simple but serviceable.
There are many optional secrets, if you're into that sort of thing.
Minit is a novel, short game that has an interesting hook and a very charming presentation.
