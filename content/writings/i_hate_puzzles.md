* Expiernece with writing the Proeprty tEst for cron algorithm
  * I just remember I needed help because I got lost in the recursion/keeping it all in my head
* Is this a special "type" of puzzle that I don't like/can't do?
  * contrast classic puzzles with programming
  * is there any interresting parallels to draw from this - is programming not puzzling?
* Why do I always feel i have a problem with "doing it for fun"?
  * don't like games/crosswords/classic puzzles
