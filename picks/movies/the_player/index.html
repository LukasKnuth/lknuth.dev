He has been getting threatening postcards from a disgruntled writer for a while.

This allows the movie to use the meta aspect of its cast for comedic commentary.
It also makes the subversive aspects of the story land even harder.
Tim Robins (The Shawshank Redemption) is great as the executive, a man with a very limited set of skills bumbling through a situation he is not at all equipped for.</p><p>I love movies about the production of movies - especially when the process isn&rsquo;t portrayed as glorious.
There is something inherently pathetic about hundreds of adults spending thousands of hours and millions of dollars playing pretend.
This movie wears that sleazy, self-important Hollywood esthetic like a well fitting 9000 dollar suite - it is deeply cynical about the industry and its practitioners.</p></div></article></main><footer><div class="h-spaced mb-5 mt-12 text-xs text-verysubtle">All content created by Lukas Knuth and licensed under the
