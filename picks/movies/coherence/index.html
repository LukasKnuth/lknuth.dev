A mix of real science as the basis and a good dose of fiction to spice things up.
But there are no spaceships or lasers here, just a group of friends at a dinner party during a comet flyby.
As the evening progresses, weird things continue to happen.</p><p>The movie shows &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people faced with something that they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to understand.
There is no expert character that is able to <em>solve</em> anything.
Everyone is equally stumped and tries to make sense of what is happening.
Theories are thrown out, bits of science sprinkled in like normal every day discourse where you&rsquo;re quite sure you read this thing some time ago that said&mldr;
It makes the movies wilder ideas feel grounded because ultimately, they are just theories by laypeople, trying to grasp at things they can&rsquo;t explain.</p><p>In the ensuing chaos and confusion, some people show their true colors.
Some rise to the occasion, others falter.
And some look to further their own causes.
We&rsquo;re watching people after all, they&rsquo;re complicated.</p><p>The movie feels intimate and raw, as the viewer you feel almost like you&rsquo;re intruding.
Shot on a budget in the directors own home with a tiny cast and no crew, this is very intentional.
And while the camera work can be disorienting at first, I think the story is better off for it.</p></div></article></main><footer><div class="h-spaced mb-5 mt-12 text-xs text-verysubtle">All content created by Lukas Knuth and licensed under the
