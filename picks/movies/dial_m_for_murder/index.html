90% of the film is people standing in the same interior set, talking.
There are few opportunities for strong visuals, although Hitchcock finds a few.
Yet the film manages to be engaging throughout its entire runtime.
The story is intelligent and just the right amount of convoluted.
Details matter in this film.
As the audience, we&rsquo;re always privy to all the information, not just that of individual characters.
You <em>can</em> see the twists and turns coming - if you pay close enough attention that is.</p></div></article></main><footer><div class="h-spaced mb-5 mt-12 text-xs text-verysubtle">All content created by Lukas Knuth and licensed under the
