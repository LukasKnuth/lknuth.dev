  work: |
    I'm learning to balance my new responsibilities and the backend work in my teams domains.
    I have moved away from delivering features as my main focus.
    Instead, I'm taking a direct role in company wide architecture work and planning.

    In addition, I now own my teams processes with the goal of making us a true cross-functional team.
    To do this, I'm adopting "Shape Up" by Basecamp, which I already enjoyed at a previous job.

    My work was twofold. Primarily, I owned the backend side of my cross-functional teams domains.
    This meant planning, implementing and observing modules to build new value propositions for our customers.

    Secondary was the work to simplify the existing system, made up of a Ruby monolith and micro-services with lots of tech debt.
    We where archiving this by integrating commodity software, rewriting legacy systems to better fit their domain and thoroughly documenting the rest.
    All under the banner of "Delightfully Boring".
