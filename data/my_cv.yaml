    I'm still an active code contributor and help stakeholders evaluate business proposals, make technical plans and then implement them.
    But the new role also allows me to focus more on leading and mentoring engineers.
    I'm actively persuing this during company sponsored "Innovation Fridays" and by organizing Lightning Talks to share knowledge.

    During this time my team launched a brand-new app and recently re-launched our main app.
    Both projects - spanning many months each - allowed us to continuously replace legacy systems with better fitting and more maintainable ones.

    My work was twofold.
    Primarily, I owned the backend side of my cross-functional teams domains.
    This meant planning, implementing and observing modules, each serving features for our customers.

    Secondary was the work to simplify the existing system, made up of a Ruby monolith and microservices with lots of tech debt.
    We were archiving this by integrating commodity software, rewriting legacy systems to better fit their domain and thoroughly documenting the rest.
    All under the banner of "Delightfully Boring".
