Last updated on <em>2025-08-30</em></p><h2 id=cycling><a href=#cycling>Cycling</a></h2><p><del>My plan in early 2025 is to take the bike <em>up</em> the Rhine from Cologne to The Hague, Holland where it ends in the North Sea.
This is roughly 360 Km, I plan to make one way of the trip in three days.
Once there, I have the option to either bike back home or take a train.</del></p><p><del>Then, later in the year, I plan to go the opposite direction and follow the Rhine <em>down</em> all the way to where the two Rhine rivers merge in Tamins, Switzerland.
This is roughly 770 Km and the terrain is rougher than going to mostly flat Holland.
I&rsquo;m planning to do it in a week, again with the option to take a train back home if need be.</del></p><p>Sadly, none of these plans came to pass.
At the end of my training for the first tour, I re-injured my right knee.
I&rsquo;ve fought with knee problems since I was 16 years old, so this isn&rsquo;t new for me.
While I&rsquo;m not in pain, the knee can&rsquo;t support multi day tours as I was planning originally.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll spend the next months recovering and assessing how realistic such a tour is to attempt next year.
I&rsquo;m pretty hung up on this at the moment.
Can&rsquo;t wait to get back into the saddle.</p><h2 id=software-engineering><a href=#software-engineering>Software Engineering</a></h2><p>I finally sat down and really got into Rust.
I&rsquo;ve had a strong interest in systems programming for a while and this year I worked through <a href=https://www.rustinaction.com/ rel=external>Rust in Action</a>.
While I&rsquo;m not an expert by a long shot, I am sufficiently hooked that I bought multiple ESP-32 microcontrollers for upcoming hardware projects.
I also have <a href=https://store.rpipress.cc/collections/getting-started/products/get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico-2nd-edition rel=external>The Raspberry Pi Book</a> to help me get started with electronics.</p><p>For my day job, I&rsquo;m reading <a href=https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/03/27/designing-data-intensive-applications.html rel=external>Writing Data-Intensive Applications</a> in the hopes of discovering and then filling the holes in my distributed system&rsquo;s knowledge.
I have opted for a more general book to cover more ground, with the option to dive deeper into specific topics as needed.</p><h2 id=work><a href=#work>Work</a></h2><p>At my current employer, I feel I have reached the end of where I can develop as purely a software engineer.
My plan is to get into a position where I get to spend more time helping colleagues out with their training and career goals.</p><p>I want to give more talks and foster a stronger environment of learning within the company.
More knowledge sharing and more experimenting on the job to get people excited about work, less focus on just delivering on deadlines.</p><h2 id=goals><a href=#goals>Goals</a></h2><p>For this year, I made the following New Year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p><ol><li>Write an article every month.</li><li>Play an Indie game every month.</li><li>Read a book every month.</li></ol><p>So far, I&rsquo;m having success in pursuing these goals, but I&rsquo;m not sure how much I believe in the positive effect.
I&rsquo;m usually quite late on writing an article, at times back-dating them when they&rsquo;re only finished a few days into the next month.
And while I did read a book per month, I didn&rsquo;t really cultivate a <em>continuous</em> reading habit.
I usually pick it back up towards the end of the month, sometimes picking books by their page count so I can still fit them into my arbitrary deadline.</p><p>The only goal that is working out great so far is playing more videogames.
Because I know that I won&rsquo;t be able to dedicate much time to them, I pick shorter experiences and I put more care into my selection.
I&rsquo;ve played some great games this way, many of which were sitting in my library for years already.</p></article></main><footer><div class="h-spaced mb-5 mt-12 text-xs text-verysubtle">All content created by Lukas Knuth and licensed under the
