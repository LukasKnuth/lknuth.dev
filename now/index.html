Last updated on <em>2025-11-25</em></p><h2 id=cycling><a href=#cycling>Cycling</a></h2><p>In August 2025, I re-injured my right knee.
I&rsquo;ve fought with knee problems since I was 16 years old, so this isn&rsquo;t new for me.
While I&rsquo;m not in pain, I&rsquo;m working through physio therapy to reduce problems and get back to serious training for next summer.</p><p>My plan again is to take the bike <em>up</em> the Rhine from Cologne to The Hague, Holland where it ends in the North Sea.
Then, later in the year, I plan to go the opposite direction and follow the Rhine <em>down</em> all the way to where the two Rhine rivers merge in Tamins, Switzerland.</p><p>These are long, multi day tours.
I&rsquo;ll see how training goes until spring and what doctor/therapists have to say about it.
For now, I&rsquo;m working on it daily, but only time will tell.</p><h2 id=software-engineering><a href=#software-engineering>Software Engineering</a></h2><p>Randomly, I discovered the Bootlin <a href=https://bootlin.com/training/embedded-linux/ rel=external>Embedded Linux course</a>, which I&rsquo;m working through right now.
After that, I&rsquo;m going to do their <a href=https://bootlin.com/training/buildroot/ rel=external>Buildroot course</a> as well, and I have an Embedded Linux project in mind to make use of this knowledge.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had a strong interest in systems programming for a while and I bought multiple ESP-32 microcontrollers for upcoming hardware projects.
I also have <a href=https://store.rpipress.cc/collections/getting-started/products/get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico-2nd-edition rel=external>The Raspberry Pi Book</a> to help me get started with electronics.</p><p>For my day job, I&rsquo;m reading <a href=https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/03/27/designing-data-intensive-applications.html rel=external>Writing Data-Intensive Applications</a> in the hopes of discovering and then filling the holes in my distributed system&rsquo;s knowledge.
I have opted for a more general book to cover more ground, with the option to dive deeper into specific topics as needed.</p><h2 id=work><a href=#work>Work</a></h2><p>At my current employer, I feel I have reached the end of where I can develop as purely a software engineer.
My plan is to get into a position where I get to spend more time helping colleagues out with their training and career goals.</p><p>I want to give more talks and foster a stronger environment of learning within the company.
More knowledge sharing and more experimenting on the job to get people excited about work, less focus on just delivering on deadlines.</p><h2 id=goals><a href=#goals>Goals</a></h2><p>For this year, I made the following New Year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p><ol><li><del>Write an article every month.</del></li><li>Play an Indie game every month.</li><li><del>Read a book every month.</del></li></ol><p><del>So far, I&rsquo;m having success in pursuing these goals</del>, but over the year my engagement has worn off.
This happened slowly over time and was recently ramped up by work becoming more demanding.
The only goal that I have stuck to is playing more videogames - which is great.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to drop everything entirely though, so I&rsquo;m planning to release a few more articles this year.
I&rsquo;m still reading books, just not at the expected cadence.
Perhaps I&rsquo;ll give this another shot next year&mldr;</p></article></main><footer><div class="h-spaced mb-5 mt-12 text-xs text-verysubtle">All content created by Lukas Knuth and licensed under the
